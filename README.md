# pySwitchbot-patched

This is a (hopefully temporary) fork of the original work from [pySwitchbot](https://github.com/Danielhiversen/pySwitchbot) which is the author's attempt to work with Switchbot. 

So thankful for the original author! We know Opensource is hard and life happens. Seems the author has not got back on [Home assitant issues](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+switchbot) or the issues on the original project or PR on the same, hence this is an attempt to (hopefully) patch the implementation. I have expressed the detailed issues in [issue 42] (https://github.com/Danielhiversen/pySwitchbot/issues/42) 

Going forward, I think we should base the HA implementation based on the Manufacturer's [python API implmentation](https://github.com/OpenWonderLabs/python-host) for HA and hence would create a new repo for the same.
